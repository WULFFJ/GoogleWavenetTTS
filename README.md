# GoogleWavenetTTS
Google Wavenet Speech Synthesized Voice from text

#Type text for custom clear and realistic voices.  Great for use with animation and phone systems.

I actually set this up to joke with people in my house and have setup to where I can type through a Raspberry Pi and play different voices.

#1 Will need API credentials from Google's API 
#2 When registering for the API, it will prompt you to download a JSON file.  Place that JSON file in a folder for safe keeping.  I reference the name and location in the script.
#3 Make appropriate changes for your download location at the end of the script.  

There is a script out there for Google TTS and the synthetic voices to help make this easier.  
However, I wanted more flexibility and for it to be able to play the voice and download it to a file.
